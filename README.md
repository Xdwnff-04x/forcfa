- Facebook brute force
- This script tries to find the password of a particular Facebook account, using a wordlist.

- It also offers a custom generator of wordlist, similar to the one used in the Mr.robot series, very useful when you have some information about a victim.

Warning: script for educational purposes, do not use it for illegal purposes,
I will not be responsible for any malicious act.
